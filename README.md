# Symfony Project

This is a Symfony project. To run it, you will need to have Symfony installed on your system. You can download Symfony from the [official website](https://symfony.com/download) or install it using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

composer require symfony/symfony

Once you have Symfony installed, you can run the project by navigating to the project directory and running the following commands:

composer install
php bin/console server:run

This will start a local web server and you can access the project at http://localhost:8000/.

To stop the web server, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where it is running.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
